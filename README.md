I select my language, time, and keyboard preferences, and click "Next." Then click "Install now." I select "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" to perform a clean installation or "Upgrade: Install Windows and keep files, settings, and applications" to upgrade my existing Windows installation.
   Step 6: I complete the setup process by following the prompts to configure my preferences, sign in with my Microsoft account, and customize my settings. Windows 11 will finalize the installation and boot to the desktop.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

   Step 1: I launch my preferred web browser. I navigate to the official Visual Studio Code website at https://code.visualstudio.com/.
   Step 2: On the VS Code homepage, I see the download button that automatically detects my operating system. I click on the button that says "Download for Windows". The download will begin automatically. I wait for the VSCodeSetup.exe file to finish downloading.
   Step 3: Once the download is complete, I locate the VSCodeSetup.exe file in my Downloads folder and double-click it to run the installer. If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), I click "Yes" to allow the installer to make changes to my device. 
   Step 4: In the installer window, I read and accept the license agreement, then click "Next.". I select the destination folder where I want to install VS Code, or I leave it as the default location, and then click "Next.".  I choose additional tasks such as creating a desktop icon, adding VS Code to the PATH (important for using VS Code from the command line), and other options, then click "Next.". I click "Install" to start the installation process. I wait for the installation to complete. Once the installation is finished, I ensure the "Launch Visual Studio Code" option is checked, then click "Finish."
   Step 5: I find the Visual Studio Code icon on my desktop or in the Start menu and open it. Install a few extensions like Prittier. Now, I have Visual Studio Code installed and set up on my computer, ready for coding!

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   Step 1: I go to GitHub and sign up for a free account. 
   Step 2: I launch my Git Bash on Windows to configure. I type the following command to set my GitHub username: git config --global user.name "ItumelengMphuti". I type the following command to set my GitHub email: git config --global user.email "itumeleng1mphuti@gmail.com". 
   Step 3: I use the cd command to navigate to the folder where my project is located, or create a new directory if I don't have one yet: cd onedrive/desktop/myproject. I type the following command to initialize a new Git repository: git init. I add the files I want to include in my first commit by using the git add command. To add all files, I use: git add . 
   Step 4: I type the following command to commit the staged files, adding a commit message to describe the changes: git commit -m "Initial commit". 
   Step 5: I go to GitHub and click on the "+" icon in the top right corner, then select "New repository.". I enter a name for my repository, add a description (optional), choose to make it public or private, and decide whether to initialize it with a README (since I've already committed locally, I do not initialize with a README). I click on the "Create repository" button.
   Step 6: On the new repository page on GitHub, I find the URL for the repository. It should look something like https://github.com/MyUsername/myproject.git. I go back to my terminal and add the remote URL to my local repository: git remote add origin https://github.com/MyUsername/MyRepository.git . I push my local commits to the remote repository on GitHub: git push -u origin master. I go back to GitHub and navigate to my repository page. I should see my initial commit and files listed there. 


4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  Step 1: I go to the official Python website at python.org and download the latest version of Python.  I run the downloaded installer. During installation, I make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH," then click "Install Now."
  Step 2:  I open my command prompt on Windows. I type the following command to verify that Python is installed correctly: python --version, this prompt should bring back a message that says version 3.12.4.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   Step 1: I open my command prompt on Windows. Navigate to my python folder using cd. I type the following command to run the script and install pip: python get-pip.py 
   Step 2: I type the following command to verify that pip is installed and to see the version number: pip --version. this should give a result similar to when I run puthon --version


6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   Step 1: I go to the official MySQL website at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/. I click on the "Download" button for the MySQL Installer for my operating system. I choose the Windows (x86, 64-bit).
